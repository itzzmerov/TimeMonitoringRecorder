# Offline Time In & Time Out Monitoring Recorder System

Welcome to **OTITOMRS**, a Time Monitoring Recorder System! 

Before I created this mobile app, I always use WPS and an Excel sheet to monitor my Time In & Time Out at work.

As a lazy person, this is so hectic and time-consuming for me. You can also add the fact that sometimes, I forgot to record or monitor my time in & time out.

That's why I created this simple app that would automate what I always do. Also, it became convenient for me to use. 

Here are the main features of this app:

> 1. Whenever you click Time In and Time Out, it will record the date and time.
> 2. Once you click the Time In and Time Out, it will be disabled for the whole day. It will be enabled for the next date.
> 3. You can use Search button where the calendar will show up and once you choose a date, it will show the data for that date only.
> 4. It also has a Show All button that will show all the data you have provided in the system.

(DEVELOPER'S NOTE: This is just the version 3 of the app, it can also be updated sooner or later. Based on my mood HAHA)
